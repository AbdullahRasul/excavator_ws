# Excavator Simulation

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to developing simulation algorithms for an autonomous excavator. The project is ongoing and aims to implement various control and decision-making algorithms to enable fully autonomous operation.

## Project Goals
1. Develop foundational algorithms for excavator autonomy.
2. Implement motion planning, perception, and control systems.
3. Integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) for enhanced decision-making.
4. Simulate real-world excavation scenarios in a ROS2-based environment.
